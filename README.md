This repository contains dotfiles (which are application configuration and settings files) which
are compatible with macOS and Linux. It also serves as a way to help me setup and maintain my Mac.

## Fresh macOS/Linux setup

1. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/jsadeli/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles`
1. Change working directory `cd ~/dotfiles`
1. Run `./setup.sh` (may need to apply `chmod +x setup.sh` first).
1. Restart the computer to finalize the process.
